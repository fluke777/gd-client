# Introduction to gd_client

This is a tool that should help you using GoodData API. There is a similar tool for Ruby which got much more attention. This api is a little different. Currently it was build to collect dependencies of objects inside projects. Thanks to Clojure functional nature it is trivial to make the requests in parallel which the ruby gem is not very well suited for.
